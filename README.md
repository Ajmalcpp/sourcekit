SourceKit
=========
SourceKit is an editor that fits inside of a modern browser. It is meant to be quick and dirty for those text editing tasks that needs to be done relatively close (context or time) to the browser.

Technical Details
-----------------
This project embeds an instance of the Mozilla SkyWriter (used to be called, Bespin) text editing component. 

This is an alpha and, as such, many things will change over the course of the coming weeks!
