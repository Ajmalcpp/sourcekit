SourceKit
=========
A Textmate like lightweight programmer's text editor right inside of Chrome. It saves files directly to Dropbox, so if you have the Dropbox sync software installed, the changes will appear locally as if you did so with a text editor! Changes will be stored remotely so naturally this same extension will pull up the same copy of the file everywhere!

Embedded is the excellent Mozilla Bespin (SkyWriter) text editor component. This allows for a very natural text editing experience while retaining Chrome's amazing JavaScript performance.
